:aloe:I’m not sure about that, Nene-chi…
:nene:What do you mean, Aloe-chan? I thought you loved music!
:aloe:Well, yeah, but it's just... it’s been almost a year since I really sang.
:aloe:My voice has gotten all rusty since then. Besides, I didn't even think to bring my-
:nene:Oh, that reminds me! Here you go!
:aloe:-... microphone. Do you always bring that with you wherever you go?
:nene:No, today’s a special occasion - the day we start working towards your re-debut!
:aloe:...Ahh...Guess your enthusiasm can’t be helped.
:aloe:I'll sing, but don’t expect Synthesizer or anything of the sort, okay?
:aloe:Eleven months of doin’ nothing but playing rhythm games and the Yak*za series, y’know?
:nene:That’s fine! Least I can do is help you to brush the dust off those cords.
:aloe:That would be nice.
