## HoloFunk
**Hololive Funkin'** (Officially shortened to HoloFunk) is a modpack for Friday Night Funkin' built on Kade Engine, featuring multiple song replacements up to and including Week 4, character asset replacements, and more goodies.

# The Cast So Far
 - **Aloe Mano** (Replacing Boyfriend)
	 - The protagonist of the main campaign, the lore of whom is based around the avatar of a certain Fifth Generation talent who was harassed into retirement. In a universe where "reincarnation" isn't an option like in Real Life's VTuber industry, HoloFunk's Aloe needs a bit of help and encouragement on Nene's end to get back on her feet. While of demonic blood, her strong sense of justice in tandem with her love of singing were what inspired her dream to become the "Diva of the Demon Realm" in the first place.
	 - Do you have the determination to help HoloFunk's Aloe along in her quest to return to fame?
 - **Nene Momosuzu** (Tutorial; Replacing Girlfriend)
	 - The deuteragonist of the main campaign, this universe's version of the bear-seal-alien idol that hundreds of thousands of Hololive fans know and love. Scatterbrained, optimistic, and convinced she's a "perfect being that consists of all living things", it is Nene that gets her close friend out of the house again and convinces her to try out rapping.
	 - She is an entirely different entity from the Nene who is associated with Pico of *Pico's School* fame, both of whom exist in the HoloFunk universe.
 - **Calliope Mori** (Week 1)
	 - HoloFunk's version of *the* rapping reaper of the same name. Seen in a slightly-simplified version of her rapper outfit compared to previous versions which just used her classic costume, Calli is not one to go easy on those that face her in a rap battle. And it shows - she's the hardest opponent in the mod so far!
	 - Her songs include "Live Again" (Live Again - Bopeebo Remix), "RAP" (失礼しますが、RIP♡ - Fresh Remix), and "Calli Battle" (Off With Their Heads - Dad Battle Remix).
 - **Gura Gawr and Amelia Watson** (Week 2)
	 - The closest two friends out of all of hololive EN's girls. On their way out of Japan (with two guests that have yet to be implemented), Ame and Gura got lost due to the latter's infamously poor sense of direction. A thunderstorm started to break out before Amelia could take the helm, and she left her time travel watch at home, so the two fled into the nearest house to take shelter. They're surprised to find out Nene was also there, killing time with a girl the time traveler and shark didn't debut in time to meet. Who knows how they got around the language barrier, but a rap battle quickly ensues.
	 - Their songs include "Sharkventure" and "Mythbuster" (Misteavous Myth-Buster).
 - **HAACHAMA** (REPLACING MONSTER)
	 - HAACHAMA CHAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
 - **Botan Shishiro** (Week 3)
	 - A white lion girl well-versed in computer technology and a competitive-level expert in first-person shooters. This universe's incarnation was a hitman prior to phasing out of that line work to pursue a (relatively) safe career at hololive. Hearing of and unwilling to deal with a potential rival's return, Daddy Dearest hires Botan to find "a certain member of a demon clan opposing his" and "teach her a lesson". But like the situation between Pico and BF, Botan was only given a location and not a name, and when she finds out the intended target is *Aloe*, she refuses to do what the job entailed and instead challenges her to a rap battle, though on friendlier terms.
	 - In lieu of tracks closely associated with her, her songs are simple covers of Pico's songs, dubbed "Botan" (Pico Remix), "La-Lion" (Philly Nice Remix), and "Poi" (Blammed Remix).
 - **Coco Kiryu** (Week 4)
	 - The dragon with leadership over the Kiryu Clan and a penchant for profanity and memes, and a strong sense of honor. After the events of week 3, Botan is forced to lay low due to her refusal to carry out Daddy Dearest's hit against her friend. In order to repay Botan, Aloe finds the resolve to reach out to Coco Kiryu, one of the few girls she knows has the resources to keep their favorite white lion's past as a hitman from getting leaked to the public. Given her role as Fourth Chairman of the Kiryu Clan, Coco can't just help someone for free, but thankfully, all it takes for Coco to offer her help without hesitation is for Aloe to prove her skills on the mic to her.
	 - She first made her debut in December 28th, 2019 to, in-universe, pay off the debts she acquired after crashing into the hololive office and hospitalizing CEO Motaki "YAGOO" Tanigo in the process, but is unfortunately set to graduate from streaming in July 1st, 2021.
	 - Her songs include "Friday Night" (Cover), "Cinderella" (24 Hour Cinderella Cover), "Gangimari" (Gangimari Dragon), and "Hands" (Cover).

# Features

 - **New Input System**
	 - An improved input system, similar to Quaver or Etterna, with less delays, less dropped inputs and other improvements.
 - **More information during gameplay**
	 - While you're playing, we show you information about how you're doing, such as your accuracy, combo break count, notes per second, and your grade/rating.
 - **Customizable keybinds**
	 - Instead of being forced to use WASD and the arrow keys, you can customize the keybinds to any keys you want!
 - **Replays** (in beta)
	 - Have you ever gotten a crazy score but didn't record? The replay system solves that: it automatically saves a "replay" of your gameplay every time you complete a song, which you can play back inside of the game. 
	 - Replays just store information about what you're doing, they don't actually record the screen -- so they take up way less space on your disk than videos.
 - **Audio offset**
	 - If your headphones are delayed, you can set an offset in the options menu to line the game up with the delay and play with synced audio like intended.
